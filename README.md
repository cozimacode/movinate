# Movinate

Movinate allows you to query the OMDb for various movies and enables you to select and nominate your favorite of them all.

You are allowed to nominate 5 of your favorite movies. You can edit your list before submission.

Access the app here: https://movinate.web.app/

## Previewing locally

1. Launch a terminal in the root directory and run the command `npm ci` to install necessary dependencies. This step only needs to be done once.
2. `npm start` command to launch the app in your local environment (requires Node.js)

## Testing

Any changes made to the app must be accompanied with proper test cases. The previous tests should pass as well to avoid any regressions. You can run them by the command `npm run test`.

## Regarding env

I am aware that I checked the .env file inside this repository as this is a free API available for everybody. Just trying to help you avoid an additional step ;)
